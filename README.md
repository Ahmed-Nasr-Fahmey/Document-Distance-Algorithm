# Document Distance Algorithm
 The DOCUMENT DISTANCE Faster Algorithm is a demonstration of an optimized approach for calculating the distance between two text documents. This project focuses on improving the efficiency of the traditional "Document Distance" algorithm, enabling faster and more scalable document similarity calculations.
