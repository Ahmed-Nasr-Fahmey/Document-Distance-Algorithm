# DOCUMENT DISTANCE Faster Algorithm in C#

## Overview

The "DOCUMENT DISTANCE Faster Algorithm in C#" project is a demonstration of an optimized approach for calculating the distance between two text documents. This project focuses on improving the efficiency of the traditional "Document Distance" algorithm, enabling faster and more scalable document similarity calculations.

## Problem Statement

The traditional "Document Distance" algorithm involves calculating the cosine similarity between two documents based on their word frequencies. While effective, this algorithm can be computationally expensive, especially for large documents or collections of documents. The goal of this project is to implement a faster algorithm that maintains the accuracy of the original approach while significantly reducing the computational time required.

## Key Features

- **Optimized Algorithm**: Implement an algorithm that leverages efficient data structures and techniques to accelerate the document distance calculation process.

- **Word Frequency Extraction**: Extract word frequencies from the input documents to represent their content.

- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculate the cosine similarity between the word frequency vectors of the two documents.

- **Faster Processing**: Showcase a notable reduction in processing time compared to the traditional algorithm, making the solution more scalable for larger datasets.

## Implementation

The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Document Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the input documents to remove noise and irrelevant information.

2. **Word Frequency Extraction**: Develop a process to extract the word frequencies from the preprocessed documents.

3. **Optimized Algorithm Design**: Design and implement an algorithm that accelerates the calculation of document distance while maintaining accuracy.

4. **Performance Evaluation**: Measure and compare the processing time of the optimized algorithm against the traditional approach using various document pairs.
